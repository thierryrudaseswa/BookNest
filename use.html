<H2>IMPACT OF READING TO CHILDREN</H2>
</div>
<div class="cont3">
<P1 class="three"><span> literary skills</span>. Reading with aloud with young children, even if they can’t fully understand what you are saying, gives them the skills they need for when they begin to read by themselves. It shows children that reading is something achieved by focusing from left to right and that turning pages is essential for continuing. Reading to children in even the earliest months of their lives can help with language acquisition and stimulating the part of the brain that processes language.</P1><br>

  <P2 class="three"><span> More extensive vocabulary</span>. Hearing words spoken aloud can expose children to a range of new vocabulary and phrases that they may not have heard otherwise. By reading to a child daily, they’ll learn new words every single day.</P2><br>



   <P3 class="three"><span> Greater concentration</span>. Regular and consistent reading can help to improve a child’s concentration abilities. Furthermore, it will help a child learn to sit still and listen for long periods of time, which will benefit them in their schooling.</P3><br>

   <P4 class="three"><span>
       Higher levels of creativity and imagination</span>. Reading a book relies on us using our imagination for picturing characters, visualising their settings and environment, and guessing what’s coming next. We must use our imagination if we are to learn about other people, places, events, and times. In turn, this developed imagination leads to greater creativity as children use the ideas in their heads to inform their work.</P4><br>
   <P5 class="three"><span>
       Finally, the more that a child is read to, and the more that they read themselves</span>, the better they will become at it. Practice really does make perfect and, the more a child reads, the better their overall academic achievement and social skills, like empathy, will be.
